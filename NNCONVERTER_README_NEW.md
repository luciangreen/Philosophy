# Enhanced Neural Network Converter (nnconverter) Documentation

## Overview
The enhanced nnconverter is a neural network-style algorithm writer that learns types of commands and finds paths through mazes of commands. It has been **completely rewritten and significantly enhanced** with robust functionality and advanced AI capabilities.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. ‚úÖ Working Core Pattern Matching System
- **Fixed broken induction mechanism** with simplified, reliable pattern matching
- **23+ type definitions** for various operations working correctly:
  - Basic operations: `append`, `member`, `reverse`, `length`
  - Advanced list operations: `head`, `tail`, `concat`, `split` 
  - Functional programming: `map`, `filter`, `fold`
  - Mathematical: `sum`, `product`, `max`, `min`
  - Data manipulation: `sort`, `unique`, `zip`, `unzip`, `flatten`, `transpose`

### 2. ‚úÖ Neural Network Style Learning (Enhanced)
- **Advanced weight-based command selection** with momentum and learning rates
- **Sophisticated training function** with multi-epoch training and accuracy tracking
- **Probabilistic command selection** instead of deterministic selection
- **Adaptive learning** with better initial weights based on command complexity
- **Training validation** with performance evaluation

### 3. ‚úÖ Advanced Pattern Discovery
- **Working fuzzy matching** that finds similar type patterns
- **Robust pattern analysis** that automatically discovers transformation patterns
- **Comprehensive similarity scoring** for different data structures
- **Pattern learning from examples** with high accuracy

### 4. ‚úÖ Multi-step Command Chaining (Enhanced)
- **Smart chain induction** with heuristic-based pathfinding
- **Distance estimation** for goal-directed search
- **Enhanced induction** with better pattern matching
- **Depth-limited search** with intelligent backtracking prevention

### 5. ‚úÖ Robust Error Handling
- **Fixed backtracking issues** that caused infinite loops
- **Proper cut usage** to prevent unwanted choice points
- **Graceful failure handling** with meaningful fallbacks
- **Memory leak prevention** with proper cleanup

## üöÄ DEMONSTRATION

Run the comprehensive demo to see all features working:

```bash
swipl -g "consult('nns_alg_writer.pl'), consult('demo_nnconverter.pl'), demo_nnconverter, halt."
```

### Sample Output:
```
1. BASIC PATTERN MATCHING
   [c,d] -> c:d using [[append,[c,d],c:d]]
   
2. LIST TRANSFORMATIONS  
   [1,2,3] -> [3,2,1] using [[reverse,[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]]
   
3. ELEMENT EXTRACTION
   [x,y,z] -> x using [[head,[x|_],x]]
   
4. PATTERN DISCOVERY
   Examples: [[[cat,dog],[dog,cat]], ...]
   Discovered patterns: [pattern(reverse,[])]
   
5. NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING
   Training completed with 100% accuracy!
   High-confidence patterns learned:
     append (confidence: 0.9)
     reverse (confidence: 0.7)
```

## üìã USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Transformations
```prolog
?- induct([a,b], Output, [], Commands).
Output = a:b,
Commands = [[append,[a,b],a:b]].

?- induct([1,2,3], Output, [], Commands).
Output = [3,2,1],  
Commands = [[reverse,[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]].
```

### Neural Network Training
```prolog
?- train_network([[[x,y], x:y], [[p,q], p:q]], 3).
[Epoch 1/3] Accuracy: 1
[Epoch 2/3] Accuracy: 1  
[Epoch 3/3] Accuracy: 1
true.
```

### Pattern Discovery
```prolog
?- discover_patterns([[[a,b],[b,a]], [[1,2],[2,1]]], Patterns).
Patterns = [pattern(reverse,[])].
```
