List of Philosophy Algorithms

* Prolog and List Prolog Algorithms
* From articles at <a href="http://lucianpedia.fandom.com/">http://lucianpedia.fandom.com/</a>.

# Getting Started

Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for running algorithms.

# Prerequisites

Install List Prolog Interpreter Repository (https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter) first.

* Download this repository.
* If the algorithm is a Prolog algorithm, in SWI-Prolog, in the relevant folder, enter:
```
['filename.pl'].
```
where filename is the name of the file.
* Enter `name_of_predicate(Input,Output).` where name_of_predicate is the main predicate of the algorithm, and the input and output arguments are given.

* If the algorithm is a List Prolog algorithm, run it in List Prolog.
* In the SWI-Prolog environment, enter:
`['listprolog'].`    

* To run a specific test:
`test1(off,TestNumber,Passed).`
where TestNumber is the test number from lpiverify4.pl in List Prolog.
